right. When the snake bites itself or goes off the canvas, the game is over.When
the snake eats a apple it grows bigger.If the snake eats all the apples in a 
certain level a new level begins where the snake is longer and moves faster.

To run the programming you need to have processing installed in your computer. Run SnakeGame.pde in
